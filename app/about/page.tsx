      <p className="mb-4">
        I’m a Senior Product Manager and AI enthusiast with several years of
        experience in product strategy, cross-functional leadership, and
        building AI-powered solutions. Throughout my career, I’ve worked on
        various projects—ranging from health applications to loyalty ecosystems—
        always focusing on user empathy and tangible impact.

      <p className="mb-4">
        In recent years, I’ve ventured into Large Language Models and AI
        development, creating apps like Mysty Health and Dayplan. I thrive on
        discovering how emerging technologies can solve real-world problems and
        enhance everyday life.

        When I’m not working on my next product, you’ll find me traveling,
        exploring new cultures, and staying active. Feel free to check out my
        Travel page for photos of some of the places I’ve visited!
